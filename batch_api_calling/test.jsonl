If Cons truction occurs when visibility is reduced such that the monitor conducting \nobservations cannot visually observe the entire Safety Zone, the SRKW observations must be conducted using a hydrophone.  \n \nAll activities and works must be conducted and monitored in such a way that there is no \nsustained underwater noise over 160dB to minimize disturbance to SRKWs.  \n \n9.
